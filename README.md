## FLEUR git repository

The primary git-repository of FLEUR can be found on the [iffgit-Server at FZ-JÃ¼lich](https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/fleur/fleur/).

You can clone the repository by using
```
git clone https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/fleur/fleur.git
```

If you are a FLEUR developer you should use
```
git clone gitlab@iffgit.fz-juelich.de:fleur/fleur.git
```
to be able to push changes back to the server. If you are not a developer yet but want to contribute, please contact [Gregor](g.michalicek@fz-juelich.de) or [Daniel](d.wortmann@fz-juelich.de).

Please note, that the default branch you will see after cloning the repository is the 'develop' branch. In general you might find 
the following branches on the server.

* develop: this is the default branch with the most up-to-date version of FLEUR. Small changes and developments should be committed 
directly into this branch. When doing so you should try to keep the code operational. It should still compile and the test should run. 
* release: this branch collects the official releases. You cannot commit to this branch and bugfixes should be handled as [described below](#bugs-and-problems).
* stable: this branch contains snapshots of the development branch considered "stable".

In addition several other branches can/will be present corresponding to features currently under development. If you start your own larger development
it can be advisable to create your own branch. In this case you should try to follow changes in 'develop' by frequently merging 'develop' into your branch
and you should create a merge request with 'develop' as soon as you are finished or reached some usefull state in your development.
