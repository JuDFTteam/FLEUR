title: Developers Documentation of FLEUR

Welcome to the developers documentation of FLEUR
========================

These pages are complementing the [User documentation](https://www.flapw.de) in which the actual use of FLEUR is documented.

Here we collect information useful for developers or advanced users that actually will modify the source code.

## GitLab
The development process is performed using gitlab. You can access the  [main gitlab page here](https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/fleur/fleur).

If you checkout the code please be aware that there are several branches. The release branch contains the code of the last release published on the FLEUR webpage. You can *not* push to this branch directly.
You probably want to use the development branch to insert your changes. If your changes are large, it might be a good idea to create your own branch first.

## More info
In the menu to the left you will find information on various topics as well as the links to the source-code documentation.
