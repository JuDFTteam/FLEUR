The G-Fleur add-on  
==================

G-Fleur is a realization of the Green function embedding technique employing
the FLAPW basis-set. It is an independent computer program but its development refers directly to the FLEUR code. 


## Features:

* Complex Bandstructures of bulk materials
* Surfaces between semi-infinite bulk and vacuum regions
* Interfaces between semi-infinite bulk leads
* Electronic transport in equilibrium and out of equilibrium

As the code is based on FLEUR many of the FLEUR features can be carried over. For example:

* Non-Collinear Magnetism
* Spin-orbit interaction
* LDA+U
