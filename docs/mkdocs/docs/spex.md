The Spex code 
================

Spex is an independent program and part of the Jülich FLAPW code family. 

It gives access to theoretical spectra and quasiparticle properties employing TDDFT and the ''GW'' approximation. As it is based on the all-electron FLAPW method, a large variety of materials can be treated. The code was written with a focus on computational efficiency and ease of use.

Features

* *GW*, HF, COHSEX, and PBE0 calculations for semiconductors, insulators, and metals
* RPA total-energy calculations
* EELS spectra (RPA)
* Magnetic response (MBPT)
* Spin-orbit coupling
* Treatment of spin-polarized systems and (semi)core states
* Self-energy evaluated with analytic continuation or contour integration
* Self-consistent *GW* (HF, COHSEX, PBE0) calculations
* Wannier support (e.g., Wannier interpolation)
* Parallelization

Missing Features
* Non-collinear magnetism (SOC can be included in second variation, though)
* TDDFT (discontinued)
* Optical response
