# Contacting the FLEUR developers

The FLEUR codes are developed in the [group of Stefan Bl√ºgel](http://www.fz-juelich.de/pgi/pgi-1/EN) at the [ Forschungszentrum Juelich](http://www.fz-juelich.de). 


# User-Support 

Please keep in mind that FLEUR is free program package that comes without liability and without  support!

However, we strongly encourage the users to participate in the FLEUR-mailing list to discuss their problems and/or experiences. Also this should be more effective than writing emails to individual persons as other users can profit from and participate in discussions on the mailing-list.

To subscribe to the list simply send a mail to [fleur-join@fz-juelich.de](mailto://fleur-join@fz-juelich.de).

Please describe your problem as accurate as possible. In particular you might include:

* version of FLEUR
* compiler version, operating system
* inp.xml -file
* error messages
* out-file (please only relevant part, i.e. last couple of lines)

# Reporting Bugs

We appreciate if you use the [Gitlab Issue system](https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/fleur/fleur/issues) to report any issues you find while using FLEUR.
