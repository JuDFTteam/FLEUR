# The FLEUR phonon cookbook
This short document serves as a guide to use FLEUR to generate phonon spectra from scratch. It highlights the necessary preliminaries, how to generate FD spectra in conjunction with the phonopy code and how to use FLEUR's DFPT capability to generate phonon data. A short section on current limitations/future developments is also given.
