Init:
   - calculate \rho-/V-gradients ONCE for all cartesian directions:
      - gradVext analytically [0 as \rho-input]
      - gradRho by numerical differentiation
      - from this: gradVeff
q-loop:
   \beta-loop:
      j-loop:
         - generate stars shifted by q with starsq%ustep and starsq%ufft
           containing not \Theta, but \Theta1 (done?)
         - make the Theta1 variables explicitly complex (ufftq,ustepq) (done)
         - add additional stars%center, that contains q [default: 0] (done)
         - have an array of G+q vectors as well (done)
         - write the skeleton structure for the scf loop
         scf-loop:
            vgen1:
               vgen_coulomb:
                  - add the possibility to generate gradV_j from gradRho_j and V1 from rho1
                     - make vgen_coulomb take a second (imaginary part) and third
                       (unperturbed) density variable [--> SF elements; done]
                     - make the inner logic understand shifted stars and 2nd den [done(?)]
                     - make sure the additional q is used explicitely!
                     - add a part constructing Vext1(l=1) instead of Vext(l=0) qlm [done]
                     - add SF qlm construction [done]
                     - make SF qlm construction sensitive to the case (V1: positive
                       prefactor and only displaced atom; gradV: negative prefactor
                       and all atoms) [done]
                     - make qlm for Vext the same [done]
               vgen_xcpot:
                  - add new subroutines with altered calls (e.g. dfpt_visxc) [done]
                  - construct the inner logic to get fxc from rho [done]
                  - add the logic to fuse fxc and rho1 into vxc1 in MT [done]

                  - add noco logic around vgen_xcpot for vmat1 [done]
            eigen1:
               tlmplm:
                  - get the matrix elements of both H and V1 [done]
                  - correct the matrix elements of H:
                    We do not need a symmetrized form (0.5, 0.5) [done]
                  - desymmetrized form for LO part [done; revision]
               hssetup:
                  - get H1 and S1 matrices from the interstitial v1%pw_w [done]
                  - get H1 and S1 matrices from the MT td and tdV1 and enpara [done]
                     - use hsmt_nonsph for the matrix elements of V1 [done]
                        - nonsph gives a full matrix as we need, but we need to teach
                          it to accept different matching coefficients for different
                          k left and right [done]
                     - use hsmt_nonsph for H-elements with perturbed matchings [done]
                     - use hsmt_sph for H/S-elements with perturbed matchings [done]
                     - LO part (hlomat/slomat):
                        - add the missing parts of the rectangular matrix
                           - bottom left rectangle [done; revision]
                           - Full LO-LO section [done; revision]
                        - Check the conjugations and usage of tuloulo! [done; revision]
                        - add fjgjq [done]
                     - add a postprocess for the perturbation prefactor [done]
                        - add it for LOs as well [done]
                  - add a redistribution routine to gain the full perturbed matrices [done]
               Analytical Matrix inversion:
                  - write routine that inverts (Hkq-\epsilonk*Skq) in a spectral representation [done]
               z1-calculation:
                  - chain together the matrix multiplication z1=-(Hkq-\epsilonk*Skq)^(-1)*(H1-\epsilonk*S1)*z0 [done (inefficient)]
                  - save z1 (and for q=0 \epsilon1) the same way z0 and \epsilon are normally saved [different eig_id!] [done]
                  - generate said eig_id beforehand [c.f. main: eig_id = open_eig(...)] [done]
            cdngen1:
               - write a control routine that calls only the fundamental necessary parts
                 of the cdngen workflow [no banddos stuff etc.] [done; dfpt_cdngen and dfpt_cdnval]
               - adapt the base level density routines to work with DFPT input
                 [done via some refactoring {cdnmt and pwden}; additionally, LOs are now also present for noco, but
                  the noco DFPT-case (as well as noco in itself) must be revised considering magic minuses]
            mixing:
               - Add MT-density imaginary part and make sure the IR-part is
                 handled correctly (4 indices)
         end scf-loop
         dynmat-row construction:
            - HF [done]
            - k-dependent (IBC)
            - SF [done, but married with HF for integrals]
      end j-loop
