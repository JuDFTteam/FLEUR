To use FLEUR with SPACK we recomment to setup a dedicated SPACK environment:

- set the FLEUR_SOURCE environment variable to the root of the FLEUR sources (This will be used by the examples to include the spack repo included here).
- do a 'spack env create YOUR_ENVIRONEMNT_NAME $FLEUR_SOURCE/packaging/spack/environments/#BEST_FITTING_EXAMPLE#.yaml'
- activate your environment and adjust your spack.yaml
