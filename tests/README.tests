This directory and its subdirectories contain the automatic tests for FLEUR.

They can be executed after compiling by running "ctest".

The following changes have to me made to create a new test:

A) Create the test scripts. Follow for example the files in tests/tests/CuBulk
1. create a sub-directory under tests/tests/TESTNAME containing your testcase
2. in TESTNAME create a test.desc file describing the test
3. in TESTNAME directory create one or more test.run1, test.run2... etc files that will be executed
4. in TESTNAME/file put files you need 
 
B) Add the test to tests/CMakeLists.txt by including the testdirectory into the list of tests.
