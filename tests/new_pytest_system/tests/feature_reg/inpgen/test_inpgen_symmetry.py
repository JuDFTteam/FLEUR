# parameterize this tests for all bulk symmetry groups (219),
# one test for each symmetry group, test if inpgen finds the right symmetries, 
# i.e is capable of doing so for a perfect cell of such symmetry




# parameterize this tests for all film symmetry groups,
# one test for each symmetry group, test if inpgen finds the right symmetries 

# TODO what about magnetic space groups?
# TODO what about 1D
# test symmetries in supercells

# test symmetry generators


# test symmetry breaking, by using labels, ids in namelists, soc, and noco
