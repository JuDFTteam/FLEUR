$test_name="Fe monolayer fcc (110): spin spiral energy";
$test_code="Fleur";
$test_stages=2;
$test_desc=<<EOF
Simple test of Fleur with two steps:
1.Generate the reference charge density
2.Calculatie spin spiral energy via the force theorem
This test was callibrated via MaX-R4 release becuase
MaX-R4 was shown to give the same results as version 26d.
Uses: spin spiral force theorem
WARNING: the test is aimed to calculate	energy difference
between	two spin spirals. If it	starts to fail,	please 
check if energy	difference between q1 and q2 remains the
same. If it is true, just adjust q1 and	q2 values in test.run2.
Otherwise there	seems to be a bug.
