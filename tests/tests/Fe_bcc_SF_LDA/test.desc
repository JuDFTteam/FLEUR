$test_name="FeBCCSFLDA: Sourcefree magnetism and magnetization scaling";
$test_code="Fleur";
$test_stages=1;
$test_desc=<<EOF
Simple test of Fleur with one step:
1.Generate a starting density in z-direction, calculate the potential and make it sourcefree. Check for the correct transformed magnetic field. And the correct resulting magnetization.
