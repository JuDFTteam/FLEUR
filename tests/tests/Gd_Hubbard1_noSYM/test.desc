Simple test of the Hubbard 1 method without Symmetries 
(and an addional onsite Green's Function on the d-orbitals to ensure the mapping is working correctly):
1. Generate starting density, run 2 Iterations with one Hubbard iteration in between
   for f-orbitals. Ensure that the density matrix is reasonable
