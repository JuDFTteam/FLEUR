Simple test of the green's function calculation with radial dependence and local orbitals in FLEUR with two steps:
1. Generate starting density, run 1 Iteration and calculate Green's function
   for d and p-orbitals (One SCLO on the p-orbitals). Ensure that the occupations from the Green's function are
   close to the MT-charges obtained
