Simple test of Fleur with four steps:
1. Generate a starting density and run 1 iteration and check Energy of Fe in collinear steup. Run iteration with noco and check again.
2. Run iteration with FFN and check again.
3. Generate a starting density and run 1 iteration and check Energy of Fe in collinear setup. Run iteration with FFN and check again.
4. Invoke LDA+U on Density from step three and check for distance.
