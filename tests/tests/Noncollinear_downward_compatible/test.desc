Simple test of Fleur with three steps:
1.Generate a starting density and run 1 iteration and check Energy of Fe in collinear steup. Run iteration with noco and check again.
2. Run iteration with FFN and check again.
3.Generate a starting density and run 1 iteration and check Energy of Fe in collinear setup. Run iteration with FFN and check again.
